    <p class="description">
        Alora, meaning “my dream”, is a collage and photography based publication that is focused on aesthetic lifestyle/art styles. It is a place of inspiration and creative source to new ideas for their dream concepts. This season’s print, Spring, features an article about creativity and what it means to be creative. The chaotic journaling style encourages the reader to release their creative freedom. The addition of a collage activity spread is a space for the user’s mind to explore and bring their ideas to life. </p>
