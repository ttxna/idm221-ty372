# Ensemble Arts
## Typography | Winter

This fictional Ensemble Arts Project reflects how visual systems are represented through a typographic identity—over print, screen, and motion.   The universal typographic system resembles the wide variety of programs and shows in the Ensemble Arts. The simplicity of the rectangular elements compliments the purpose of the grid structure. 

# Botanical Bash
## Exhibition Design | Winter 24

Exhibitions tell stories, change perspectives, and enhance visitors’ experience of the art that is presented.   Botanical Bash tells the story of Mary Gibson Henry and her long life dedication to the science and art of her botanical specimen collection. Through a carefully curated space of her collection, alongside with an activity table, visitors can learn through the art of viewing and doing. 

# Alora
## Publication | Spring 23

Alora, meaning “my dream”, is a collage and photography-based publication that is focused on aesthetic lifestyle/art styles. It is a place of inspiration and a creative source for new ideas for their dream concepts.   This season’s print, Spring, features an article about creativity and what it means to be creative. The chaotic journaling style encourages the reader to release their creative freedom. The addition of a collage activity spread is a space for the user’s mind to explore and bring their ideas to life. 

# 7-Eleven
## Redesign | Winter 22
For a group collaboration, teams were assigned a company to redesign mobile and desktop applications; 7-Eleven is a popular convenience store that sells goods from slurpees to hot foods. The redesign is minimalistic and chic, which pairs well with the small stylistic details. The motifs demonstrate the variety the store carries, appealing to the customers’ eye.
